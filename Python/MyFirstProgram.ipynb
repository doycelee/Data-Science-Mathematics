If you ever played any sort of loot based game, your loot depends on some variation of a random number generator. \n",

Lets rename random as rm such that every time we call upon function from that package, we can use the rm alias. This is very similar naming convention when you define tables in a SQL join. You need to use the package alias to tell the program to find a specific function from a specific package. \n",
